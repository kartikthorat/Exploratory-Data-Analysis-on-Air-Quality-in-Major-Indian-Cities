# 🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis on Air Quality in Major Indian Cities

## 📌 Project Overview
This project dives into India’s urban air pollution data from 2015–2020, analyzing major pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃) across several cities. It uses EDA techniques to uncover patterns, seasonal variations, and areas of concern — all without machine learning.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source**: [Air Quality Data in India (2015–2020) – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india)
- Includes daily pollutant levels for multiple cities  
- Format: `CSV`, 1 row per day per city

---

## ⚙️ Methods & Techniques
- Time series analysis (trend + seasonality)
- Correlation analysis via heatmaps
- City-wise comparisons using bar plots
- Safe-limit assessment against WHO standards
- Seasonal AQI boxplots & event-based anomalies

---

## 🔍 Key Findings
- Cities like **Delhi** and **Kanpur** exceed safe AQI levels on >80% of days  
- Significant pollution spikes during winter and post-Diwali  
- Correlation found between pollutant concentrations and meteorological variables

---

## 📊 Tools Used
- `Python`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
- Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and visualization

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Extend project to include geospatial mapping (Plotly / GeoPandas)  
- Add dashboard interactivity using Dash or Streamlit  
- Overlay demographic and policy data for deeper insights
